Video-01

## Description
_______________________________________________________________________________________
A simple video streaming application that can be inserted into existing projects.  In this case the project is "Recipe-For-Success".  The project was a collaboration between students to showcase their learning of a MERN application using Stripe payments.
As the project is about recipes, we wanted to include videos of meals that can be created using recipes featured on the website.  We would upload a video with step-by-step instructions on how to prepare the meal that users can follow.  The site would have a catologue of videos to choose from.

## Installation
_______________________________________________________________________________________
To run the website you must run:
Open 'backend-video' using terminal and run the command "node index".
Open a second terminal from frontend-video, cd into "video-stream-frontend-videos", run the command "npm start"
